# Cloud-Based-Livestock-Monitoring-Dashboard

The project was connected through the firebase project’s private key in python where our data is stored. After which the data was retrieved according to the collection it was named under (i.e. tracking in this case) and a basic web application was generated using Streamlit named ‘Animal Tracking System’. Through Pandas the data was then converted to a dataframe for easy segregation. Furthermore, it was then skimmed to see for the presence of the columns specifically tags, latitude and longitude. A simple threshold-based approach is used to determine the states of the cow here taken only two- lying and standing. This approach assumes that when a cow is standing, there will be more movement (higher gyroscope magnitudes) compared to when it’s lying down. The threshold in 'calculate_orientation' function is what decides between these two states. This function calculates the tilt angle (angle from vertical or the z axis) and the rotation angle (in the horizontal plane/ x-y plane) from the gyroscope data. The tilt helps in determining whether the cow is standing or lying and the rotation helps in representing the direction the cow is facing. I assumed that the cow is lying if the tilt is greater than 45 degrees. This was decided through 'determine_position' function. The sidebar is created using Streamlit's built-in functions, which automatically handle the layout and interactivity. When a user makes a selection, Streamlit reruns the script with the new selections, updating the main content area accordingly. It allows user to select a single cow for trajectory viewing from the dropdown menu or select multiple cows to view their current locations from the multi-select box in the sidebar. The main content area is responsible for processing the data based on user selections from the sidebar, performing calculations, creating the visualization, and displaying it to the user. It handles both the single cow trajectory view and the multiple cow current location view, combining them into a single interactive map. For the single selected cow, it adds traces for orientation lines in blue, cow positions (green markers for standing, red markers for lying) and the trajectory in grey lines. For multiple selected cows it adds traces for their latest positions. The code uses Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for calculations, and Plotly for creating the interactive map visualization. Streamlit is used to display the results and handle the web app interface.
